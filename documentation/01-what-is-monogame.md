In this chapter, we'll explore the history of MonoGame, what features it provides developers to create games.  

## A Brief History
In 2006, Microsoft released a game development framework named *XNA Game Studio* to facilitate game development for Windows PC and the Xbox 360 console.  It revolutionized game development for indie creators by bringing a simplified approach to building games and offering a set of tools that lowered the entry barrier for aspiring game developers.  Out of XNA Game Studio came critically acclaimed titles such as [Bastion](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/bastion/) and [Terraria](https://terraria.org/).  In 2008, XNA was expanded to support development for both the Zune and Windows Phone.

> [!NOTE]
> Fun fact, provided by community member stromkos, The release of XNA 3.0 in 2008, which added the support for Windows Phone, is also the release that specified the default window resolution of 800x600 for new projects as this was the preferred resolution on Windows Phone.  It is still the default resolution used in MonoGame projects today.

As XNA become more popular, the need for cross-platform development started to grow.  In 2009, [JosÃ© Antonio Leal de Farias](https://github.com/jalf) introduced *XNA Touch*, an open-source project that aimed to make games with XNA playable on iOS devices.  This marked the beginning of what would later become MonoGame.  [Dominique Louis](https://github.com/CartBlanche) came on board in 2009 and soon took over as full-time project lead, driving its initial development and expansion. The project attracted other developers such as [Tom Spilman](https://github.com/tomspilman) who were interested in expanding the scope of the project as well as its reach.

The official first release of MonoGame occurred in 2011, as an open source version of XNA.  While it still had the same familiar API as XNA, the cross-platform support was expanded to include Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, XBox, and Playstation.  Despite Microsoft discontinuing XNA in 2013, MonoGame continued to grow and develop.   Maintenance of the project was given to [Steve Williams](https://github.com/KonajuGames) and [Tom Spilman](https://github.com/tomspilman) in 2014. In order to direct its future developments and undertaking, the [MonoGame Foundation](https://monogame.net/about/) was formed on September 29th, 2023. 

Today, it is a mature, cross-platform framework, that is built with the spirit of preserving XNA but adopting modern game development practices. Some popular titles created using MonoGame include [Celeste](https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/), [Stardew Valley](https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/), and [Streets of Rage 4](https://store.steampowered.com/app/985890/Streets_of_Rage_4/).

## Features
MonoGame, following in the footsteps of XNA, is a "bring your own tools" framework.  It provides developers the basic blocks to design the game, engines and/or tools.  As a code-first approach to game development, MonoGame does not include any pre-built editors or interfaces; instead it gives developers the freedom to create their own working environment.

### API

At it's core, MonoGame offers a set of libraries and APIs to handle common game development tasks.  These include

1. **Graphics Rendering**: 2D and 3D rendering are supported through the graphics API offered by MonoGame.  This API provides sprite batching for 2D graphics, a flexible 3D pipeline, and shaders for custom visuals and effects.
2. **Input Handling**: Input from keyboard, mouse, game pads, and touch screens is supported, allowing for development of games for any platform and different styles of play.
3. **Audio**: A comprehensive audio system that can be used to create sound effects as well as play music with included support for many audio formats.
4. **Content Pipeline**: An out-of-the-box workflow for importing and processing game assets such as textures, models and audio, compiling them to a format that is optimal for the game's target platform.
5. **Math Library**: A math library specifically optimized for game development, providing essential mathematical functions and operations.

### Cross Platform
One of the main advantages of MonoGame is its cross-platform support.  Games built with MonoGame are compatible with a variety of platforms including:

- **Desktop**: Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Mobile**: iOS and Android.
- **Consoles**: Xbox, Playstation, and Nintendo Switch [(with appropriate license)](https://docs.monogame.net/articles/console_access.html).

By providing cross-platform support, developers can target multiple platforms from a single codebase, significantly reducing development time and resources needed for porting.  

### Programming Language Support

MonoGame is designed and build in C#.  It is the official programming language supported in documentation, samples, and community discussion. However, MonOGame is not exclusively tied to C#.  As a .NET lirary, MonoGame can be used with any .NET-compatible language including Visual Basic and F#.

> [!CAUTION]
> While the alternative .NET languages can be used, community support may be limited outside the scope of C#.

Regardless of which .NET language used, developers shoudl have a foundational understanding of the language and programming concepts such as:

- Object-oriented programming.
- Data types and structures.
- Control flow and loops.
- Error handling and debugging.
