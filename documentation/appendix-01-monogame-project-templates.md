# Appendix 01: MonoGame Project Templates

This appendix contains information on the C# project templates offered by MonoGame and what each is used for.

MonoGame offers several templates to create a new project based on the platform(s) you are targeting and ancillary project templates for extensions and libraries.

In VSCode and Visual Studio 2022, when you create a new .NET project, you can see the MonoGame templates available to create the project with. You can also see a list of the MonoGame templates by opening a _Command Prompt_ or _Terminal_ window and executing the command

```sh
dotnet new list MonoGame
```

The following table lists the different templates available and what they are used for
