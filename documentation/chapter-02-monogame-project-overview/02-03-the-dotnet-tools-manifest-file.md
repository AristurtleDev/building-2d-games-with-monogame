# Chapter 2-3: The dotnet Tools Manifest File

The *dotnet-tools.mgcb* manifest file, located in the */.config/* directory in the project root directory, defines the tools used by the project that are distributed via NuGet.  When a new MonoGame project is created, this file is automatically generated for you containing the necessary tools used during development.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "isRoot": true,
  "tools": {
    "dotnet-mgcb": {
      "version": "3.8.2.1105",
      "commands": [
        "mgcb"
      ]
    },
    "dotnet-mgcb-editor": {
      "version": "3.8.2.1105",
      "commands": [
        "mgcb-editor"
      ]
    },
    "dotnet-mgcb-editor-linux": {
      "version": "3.8.2.1105",
      "commands": [
        "mgcb-editor-linux"
      ]
    },
    "dotnet-mgcb-editor-windows": {
      "version": "3.8.2.1105",
      "commands": [
        "mgcb-editor-windows"
      ]
    },
    "dotnet-mgcb-editor-mac": {
      "version": "3.8.2.1105",
      "commands": [
        "mgcb-editor-mac"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
> [!NOTE]
> This is not a file you would normally need to edit.  However, if you ware updating to a new version of MonoGame in the future, you will need to edit this file for existing projects that are being update to change the version number to match the version of MonoGame you are updating too.


The table below contains a brief overview of what each of these tools are used for

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **dotnet-mgcb** | This contains the **MonoGame Content Builder** tool that is responsible for compiling the assets added to your content project. |
| **dotnet-mgcb-editor** | This contains the **MonoGame Content Builder Editor** tool used to open the content project file and provides a visual UI managing the assets to add to your content project. |
| **dotnet-mgcb-editor-linux** | This contains the bootstrap launcher tool to open the **MonoGame Content Builder Editor** on a Windows operating system. |
| **dotnet-mgcb-editor-windows** | This contains the bootstrap launcher tool to open the **MonoGame Content Builder Editor** on a Linux operating system. |
| **dotnet-mgcb-editor-mac** | This contains the bootstrap launcher tool to open the **MonoGame Content Builder Editor** on a macOS operating system. |

These tools are necessary if you are using the **Content Pipeline** to manage and load assets in your game.  These tools are also expected to be part of the project for the **MonoGame.Content.Builder.Task** NuGet package mentioned earlier in the C# project file.  We'll discuss these more in detail during [Chapter 3: The Content Pipeline](../chapter-03-the-content-pipeline/03-00-the-content-pipeline.md).

> [!NOTE]
> It may seem wasted to include the **MonoGame Content Builder Editor** launchers for all three operating system types, especially if you are only developing on one operating system.  However, by including all three, it makes it easier if you ever need to switch to a different operating system for your project, or when working on a team where the code is shared using a git repository and team members have different operating system.
