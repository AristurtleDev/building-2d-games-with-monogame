# Chapter 07: Designing MonoGameSnake

---

Before jumping directly into coding a game, it's always best to start with designing an initial concept first.  These are sometimes referred to as a [Game Design Document (GDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_design_document).  A GDD is a living document is used to organize and describe the overall design of the game, from the systems and mechanics to the artwork direction and visual design.  Even for small games, having a GDD is helpful because it gives an overall view of the finished product and gives the developer a reference while developing the game.  In this chapter, we're going to create a simplified design document for the finished MonoGameSnake game, which we'll use in subsequent chapters to take our prototype and make a completed game.
