# Building 2D Games with MonoGame
We are currently in an era of game development where the number of tools available to the average person is astounding.  The number of new game releases every week, especially in the indie to small studio section, continues to climb as the tools become easier to use and add more features.  Being in this age of game development, it's easy to look at successful games like Celeste and think "I can just use the same tools", then jump in without fully understanding the whole scope.  Game development, including the actual code, is an art form.  Much like any art form, having tools isn't enough.  You wouldn't expect to be handed a canvas, some paint, and a brush and then paint the Mona Lisa.  You would need to understand the tools your using, how the brush and canvas interact, the different techniques for brush strokes and paint mixing, and lots of practice.  Then when you've reached a level of comfort with the tools, you could attempt a Mona Lisa.

The documentation in this repository is intended to cover the concepts of game development using the MonoGame framework as our tool.  We'll take all the foundational aspects of game development and create a Snake game. Each chapter is broken into individual sections that introduce new concepts that we can build off of.  While we'll have created a Snake game by the end of this tutorial, that isn't the actual goal. The game is just a vehicle used to introduce the concepts.  The goal in the end is to have a solid foundation of 2D game development using MonoGame and to have created reusable modules that can be expanded and used in any future projects as a jump start.

Since we'll be using the MonoGame framework as our tool, this means we'll be using C# as the programming language.  Readers should have a foundational understanding of C# and be comfortable with concepts such as classes and objects. If you are entirely new to C# or programming in general, I recommend following the official [Learn C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/csharp) tutorials provided by Microsoft. These free tutorials teach you programming concepts as well as the C# language.  Once you have a good foundation with C#, come back and continue here.
